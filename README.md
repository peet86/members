# Vienna.html Members Directory

Welcome. Join Us. Free. No Database Required - Just Some YAML ;-) 


## How To Add Yourself

Step 1: Add yourself to the member list, that is, [members.yml](members.yml). Example:

``` yaml
- name:    Henry Jekyll                 # your name (required)
  github:  henryj                       # your github handle (required)
  web:     drjkeylls.com                # blog or website address/url (optional)
  twitter: henry                        # your github handle (optional)
```

Step 2: There's no Step 2 ;-)

That's it. Thanks! Wait for the next site update to get listed on the members page. Welcome to Vienna.html.


## Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.s) and Answers

#### Q: Will there be a meetup.com group for Vienna.html?

A: Sorry. No. We will use a GitHub org (you're looking at the org ;-) for signups, events etc.

#### Q: How do I sign up?

A: See above e.g. add yourself and send in a pull request. Your pull request gets merged and you will also get
an invitation (by email from GitHub) to join the Vienna.html org as a member. If you accept, you can edit the
member.yml in your browser - no longer any need for a pull request - and you will if show up in the 
[people page](https://github.com/orgs/substance/people) too (if you set your preference
to public - default is private).
